# MSFT_DevDiv_GAT_Data

This repository contains data dumps from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2019-2021. 

The data is currently in a "long" format, where each row is a response to a question. Respondents have been assigned an ID which is consistent across a single year, but not across years (e.g., All ResponseIds of 23 are for the same respondent for 2021, but this is not the same "person" as ResponseId 23 in 2020).

The data does _not_ need to stay in "long" format, it can be pivoted to a "wide" format, separated out into different tables/files or whatever else makes it easier to answer the questions posed. 

The data has not been entirely sanitized. There may be odd characters from time to time. Demographic data has been purged as to add as much anonymity as possible.
